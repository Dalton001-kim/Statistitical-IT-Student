Dalton Kimani– STA 2102: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR STATISTICS

1. Introduction to Information Technology (IT)
- IT involves the study, design, development, implementation, support, and management of computer-based information systems.
- Originally used in the 1960s–1970s mainly for storing information in institutions.
- Modern IT supports automation, decision-making, communication, data processing, and productivity.
- IT specialists configure hardware/software, install networks, manage security, create web pages, and maintain systems.

2. Classification and Types of Computers
Supercomputers:
- Extremely powerful, very fast, expensive.
- Used for weather forecasting, scientific simulations, nuclear research.

Mainframes:
- Support thousands of users at once.
- Used in banks, insurance firms, government.

Minicomputers:
- Mid-range systems supporting dozens to hundreds of users.

Workstations:
- High-performance computers for engineering, CAD, graphics, and software development.

Personal Computers (PCs):
- Single-user systems.
- Types include desktop, tower, laptop, notebook, subnotebook, handheld, palmtop, PDA.

3. Data vs Information
- Data: raw, unprocessed facts.
- Information: processed, meaningful data.

4. Bits, Bytes, and Storage Units
- Bit: smallest unit of data (0 or 1).
- Byte: 8 bits; stores one character.
- Storage units based on powers of 2 (binary).

5. Analog vs Digital Signals
Analog:
- Continuous signals; high detail but easily affected by noise.

Digital:
- Discrete signals (0 and 1); less noise, easy to store, transmit, and process.

Advantages of digital:
- Error correction, high capacity, easy copying, efficient transmission.

6. Computer Hardware Components

Input Devices:
- Keyboard, mouse, scanner, trackball, joystick.

Output Devices:
- Monitor, printer, speakers.

Memory:
Primary memory (RAM):
- Fast, temporary, expensive.
- Stores running programs and data.

Secondary storage:
- Permanent; includes hard disks, CDs, flash drives.

CPU (Central Processing Unit):
- The “brain” of the computer.

CPU components:
1. ALU (Arithmetic & Logic Unit): performs calculations and logical operations.
2. Control Unit: coordinates all computer activities.
3. Registers: fast, tiny storage for temporary data.

Important registers:
- Program Counter (PC): address of next instruction.
- Instruction Register (IR): current instruction.
- MAR (Memory Address Register)
- MDR (Memory Data Register)
- General-purpose registers (R0–Rn)

7. File Types and Storage Organization
Serial/Sequential Files:
- Records stored in the order created.
- Searching is slow.
- Used in transaction logs.

Random Access Files:
- Fixed-length records.
- Fast access using addresses.

Disk Storage:
- Organized into tracks and sectors.
- Sectors store blocks of data.
- Clusters are groups of sectors.

8. System Software
Categories:

1) System Management Programs:
- Operating systems, database managers, communication systems.

2) System Support Programs:
- Utilities, performance monitors, security tools.

3) System Development Programs:
- Compilers, editors, IDEs, CASE tools.

9. Operating Systems (OS)
Roles of OS:
- Resource management (CPU, memory, devices)
- Task management (multitasking)
- File management (creating, deleting, reading files)
- User interface (GUI or command line)

Booting Process:
- OS loads from storage into memory.
- Interrupt tables and device drivers are loaded.

10. Utility Software
- Used for maintenance, optimization, diagnostics.

Examples:
- Antivirus, backup utilities, disk defragmenters,
- Disk cleanup tools, compression tools,
- Encryption utilities, file managers.

11. Compilers
- Translate high-level programs to machine code.

Compiler stages:
- Lexical analysis
- Parsing
- Syntax checking
- Semantic analysis
- Code generation
- Code optimization

12. Variable-Length Codes
- Codes where symbols use different lengths.
- Short codes for frequent symbols, long codes for rare symbols.
- Used in data compression (Huffman, Shannon-Fano).
- Must be uniquely decodable.

13. ASCII
- 7-bit encoding standard (128 characters).
- Includes letters, digits, punctuation, control characters.
- Extended ASCII uses 8 bits (256 characters).

14. Number Systems
Binary (Base 2):
- Digits: 0, 1
Octal (Base 8):
- Digits: 0–7
Decimal (Base 10):
- Digits: 0–9
Hexadecimal (Base 16):
- Digits: 0–9, A–F

Each system is used for different computing tasks.

15. The World Wide Web (WWW)
- A system of interlinked documents accessed online.

Components:
- Internet: global network infrastructure
- Servers: store and deliver web pages
- Browsers: retrieve and display pages

How the Web Works:
- User types a URL.
- Browser sends DNS query.
- DNS returns server IP.
- Browser sends HTTP request.
- Server responds with webpage content.
