# Statistitical-ITSUMMARY OF STA 2102 – INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR STATISTICS

1. Introduction to IT
- IT deals with design, development, use, and management of computer-based systems.
- Used for automation, decision-making, communication, and productivity.
- IT specialists select, install, integrate, secure, and maintain hardware/software.

2. Classification of Computers
- Supercomputers: Extremely fast, for scientific work and simulations.
- Mainframes: Support thousands of users at once.
- Minicomputers: Mid-range, support hundreds of users.
- Workstations: High-performance single-user systems for graphics and engineering.
- Personal Computers: Single-user; desktops, laptops, notebooks, handhelds, palmtops, PDAs.

3. Data and Information
- Data: Raw facts.
- Information: Processed data with meaning.

4. Bits, Bytes, and Number Systems
- Bit: Smallest unit (0 or 1).
- Byte: 8 bits.
- Number systems: Binary, Octal, Decimal, Hexadecimal.

5. Analog vs Digital Signals
- Analog: Continuous signals, high detail, but noisy.
- Digital: Discrete 0s and 1s, less noise, easier to store.

6. Computer Components
Input: Keyboard, mouse, scanner.
Output: Monitor, printer.
Memory:
- Primary (RAM): Fast, temporary.
- Secondary: Hard disks, tapes.
CPU:
- ALU: Arithmetic and logic.
- Control Unit: Coordinates all operations.
- Registers: High-speed temporary storage.

7. File Types and Access Methods
- Serial/Sequential: Records stored in order; slow search.
- Random Access: Fixed-length records; fast access.
- Data files: Store information for later use.

8. Operating Systems
Functions:
- Resource management
- Task management
- File management
- User interface
Examples: DOS, Windows, Unix, Mac OS.

9. Utility Software
Examples:
- Antivirus
- Backup tools
- Disk cleaners
- Disk defragmenters
- File managers
- Compression utilities

10. Compilers
- Translate source code into machine code.
- Steps: Lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, code generation, optimization.

11. Variable-Length Codes
- Codes with different lengths (Huffman, Shannon-Fano).
- Used for lossless data compression.

12. ASCII
- 7-bit encoding for letters, numbers, and symbols (128 characters).

13. Web and Hypermedia
- Hypermedia: Text, images, audio, videos linked together.
- World Wide Web: Interlinked documents accessed via the internet.
Components:
- Internet (network infrastructure)
- Servers (store information)
- Web browsers (access information)
